# Hi, I'm Saqib.

Welcome to my personal portfolio website where I document my projects and publish writeups on the latest CVEs.

## Overview

This website showcases my work in cybersecurity through:

- **Homelab Projects** — hands-on labs, network builds, AD environments, malware analysis experiments, container setups, and more.  
- **CVE Writeups** — simplified breakdowns of new vulnerabilities, their impact, and how to exploit or defend against them.
- **Technical Blog** — security tips, blue-team practices, hardening guides, and learning notes.
- **Modern Frontend Stack** — fast, typed, and built for scalability.
